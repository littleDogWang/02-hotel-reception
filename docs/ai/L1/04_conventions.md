# 04 Conventions

> Runtime and change rules for this independent scenario.

## Code Style

Use English TypeScript/documentation and existing ESLint conventions. Keep examples fictional and U.S.-based, with explicit IANA time zones and date-correct offsets. Use pinned pnpm 9.15.9; do not rewrite the lockfile with another major.

## Runtime Patterns

Keep StrictMode `isReady` and stable RTC client ownership. Hook cleanup owns leave, microphone closing and publication. Toolkit initialization follows RTC join/RTM readiness. Preserve local-user UID remap and interrupted turns. Tailwind 4 scans actual components through app/globals.css; do not recreate old HSL-channel wrappers.

`lookup_room_status` calls `GET /api/scenarios/02-hotel-reception/room-status` with `room_type` and `date`. Direct API clients can instead use `check_in` and `check_out` for a 1–31-night stay. The response identifies `local_fixture` data and keeps `booking_confirmed: false`.

Availability does not create a booking. No reservation, payment, upgrade, cancellation, callback submission or human transfer is implemented. All inventory is fictional, not a live property-management feed.

## Testing Patterns

Use mocked API/scenario checks for deterministic contracts and isolated temporary storage for writes. `pnpm run verify` is canonical; `pnpm run verify:docker` separately checks image/startup/route behavior. Real speech and cloud callbacks remain independent. For UI changes, render and inspect actual desktop/mobile states; do not infer visuals from source.

## Documentation Changes

Synchronize README, AGENTS, ARCHITECTURE, public/internal recipes and affected L1/L2 files when workflows, environment, state or interfaces change. Update L0's review date. Every L1 file ends in Related Deep Dives. Use conventional commits only when explicitly requested; remote writes need their own authorization.
