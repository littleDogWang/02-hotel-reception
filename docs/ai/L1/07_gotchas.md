> High-impact setup and business-state pitfalls.

## Setup Pitfalls

- pnpm 8 does not match lockfile 9; use declared pnpm 9.15.9.
- Missing .env.local values fail doctor; do not log or paste credentials.
- Docker needs a running engine and the public App ID at build time. A runtime-only ID cannot repair an already-built client bundle.
- A private/localhost callback URL cannot be used as a cloud business-tool origin.

## Runtime Pitfalls

Hotel FAQ, room types and dated sample counts enter the prompt at session start. They support discussion of fictional availability without calling a business tool.

Availability does not create a booking. No reservation, payment, upgrade, cancellation, callback submission or human transfer is implemented. All inventory is fictional, not a live property-management feed.

The voice app and read-only inventory route can share a Next.js deployment. The route reads packaged hotel.json on each request. Editing inventory on a writable local server is visible to API calls without restart; changing a hosted bundle requires redeployment. Start a fresh conversation after prompt-data changes.

Keep combined token privileges, StrictMode initialization, toolkit readiness and hook-owned cleanup. A missing transcript is an RTM/event question, not evidence that the model never responded. Tool failures cannot silently fall back to fixture success.

## Documentation Or Contract Drift

The repository identity must be `littleDogWang/05-hotel-reception`, while upstream attribution remains separate. Keep invite fields, data paths, time zones, Docker volume behavior and pnpm/verification commands synchronized. Run `pnpm run verify:template` for structure/link drift and the canonical checks for source behavior.
